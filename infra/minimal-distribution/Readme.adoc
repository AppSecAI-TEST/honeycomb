= Honeycomb minimal distribution
This is a minimal, statically wired distribution of Honeycomb. It wires all the dependencies from Opendaylight with
Honeycomb infrastructure code in order to provide a lightweight runnable distribution utilizing Google's guice for DI.

It is lightweight because:

1. Not using ODL's config subsystem
2. Not using ODL's global (clustered) MD-SAL
3. Wiring only minimal necessary subset of ODL components together

== How to build&use
Regular maven build (install) creates an ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-infra.zip (or tar.gz) that can be
unpacked and HC can be started using honeycomb.sh script

== How to run from IntelliJ
Just mark the src/config folder as resources root and you should be able to run Main from Intellij
